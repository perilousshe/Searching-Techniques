Linear search vs binary search






Time complexity of linear search: 
Best case:O(1)
Average case:O(n)
Worst case:O(n)
----------------------------------
Time complexity of binary search:
Best case : O(log n)
Average case : 0(log n)
Worst case : O(log n)


Binary search is faster than linear search because of its time complexity.
So overall binary search is better than linear search but except best case of Sequential / linear search .


# Note : Binary search algorithm works on *sorted array* & it's based on divide and conquer rule .
